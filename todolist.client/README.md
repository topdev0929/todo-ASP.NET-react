# Todo List App

Hello Candidate,

Here's your task. Show us how good you are.


## Getting Started
See, our project manager is crazy about AI, so he asked chatGPT to create a todo list app for him. But chatGPT being a bot, created a todo list app that is not really working. We need you to fix it.
Try to find out what simple mistake(s) chatGPT made and fix them.

## Task
Here's also some additional tasks you can do to show off your skills:
- Get the project up and running
- Fix the bug(s) in the code
- Refactor the code to use React's Context API and hooks
- Implement the delete functionality
- Make the todo list app look better, here's a [design](https://www.figma.com/design/yiALIxk4el7wBgSbIAwPjM/Figma-basics?node-id=1669-162202&t=6EsVEJQDtovXSYis-0) the project manager's son made, and he studied design abroad, so you know it looks great. You'll get extra points if you can make it responsive.
- Create a test to filter the todos by their status

## All done?
Great! Bring the code with you to the interview, we'll discuss it there.
